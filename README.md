# CMOS_processor

This is a tool to provide a custom functionality for the Aconity Midi+ machine.
The main goal is to provide coordinates to extracted images from the .mkv file that gets generated for the CMOS camera when exposing a part.
The tool utilizes the .pcd files which are generated for the pyrometers when exposing a part.

The tool was developed in the scope of a semester thesis at the AM|Z laboratory of ETH ZÃ¼rich.
